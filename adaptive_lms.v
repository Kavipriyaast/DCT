// Module: adaptive_lms
// Description: This module implements an adaptive filter using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm.
//              The LMS algorithm adjusts the filter coefficients to minimize the error between the
//              desired and actual output. The module is parameterized to handle different bit widths.

    input clk, rst,  // Clock and reset signals

    input signed [bit_width-1:0] x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7,  // Input samples
    output reg signed [bit_width-1:0] coeff0, coeff1, coeff2, coeff3, coeff4, coeff5, coeff6, coeff7  // Adaptive filter coefficients

            // The result is right-shifted by 8 bits to scale the update step size
