// Module: or_and_adder
// Description: This module implements a simple adder using OR and AND operations.
//              It performs an approximate addition by using the OR operation for the sum
//              and an OR reduction of the AND operation for the carry-out. This approach
//              is often used in approximate computing to reduce complexity and power consumption.

module or_and_adder(A, B, sum, carry_out);
    input [15:0] A, B;  // 16-bit input operands
    output [15:0] sum;  // 16-bit approximate sum output
    output carry_out;   // Approximate carry-out

    // Perform OR operation for approximate sum
    assign sum = A | B;

    // Perform OR reduction of AND operation for carry-out
    assign carry_out = |(A & B);
